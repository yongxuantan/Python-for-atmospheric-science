## Microsoft Malware Prediction project
### An attempt at applying classification algorithms to predict whether a device was infected or not

#### Programs:
- run.py: execution program
  - Input: null, ensure a sample data.csv file is in same directory. Can update to user specify file path.
- data_clean.py: preprocessing data, inspired by source 2.
- train_models.py: model training code

#### Data: to large to upload, see source 1.

#### Imagees:
- forest10000.png: validation accuracy of random forest using different K
- k-neighbors10000.png: validation accuracy of KNN using different K

#### Took aways:
1. Random forest performed best
2. 81 features are way too much, would ideally want to keep under 20
3. With winner being at 70% accuracy, the current dataset was not very useful for the task
